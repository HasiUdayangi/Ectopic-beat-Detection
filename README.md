Ectopic Heartbeat Detection from ECG Signals using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal analysis is widely used to diagnose various cardiac and non-cardiac diseases. Detecting abnormalities on ECG is critical for preventing the onset of life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. This paper proposed a method based on deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to detect abnormal heartbeats such as ventricular ectopic beats (VEB) and supraventricular ectopic beats (SVEB). The proposed model was trained and validated on two large-sample PhysioNetâ€™s MIT-BIH datasets. A separate test result showed overall accuracy of 96% on distinguishing three types of heartbeats VEB, SVEB, and other heartbeats which are not ectopic beat (NOTEB).
